# Eve Framework - Quick Introduction #

## disclaimer ##

Eve Framework is in early development stage. It is not yet recommended to use in prodcution.

## "sites" and "remotes" ##

Basicialy "site" is a web-service you will be building. In production environment it can operate under multiple domains (but usually one).
"remote" is a web server that will be serving this service. 

Eve Framweork is designed to be scalable so one site can work on multiple remotes.
On the other hand to serve lots of tiny sites can be served from one remote and thay will share the code and data-base and can be updated/managed all together.

One special remote, called 'dev' is your local development environment. It will serve all available sites.
